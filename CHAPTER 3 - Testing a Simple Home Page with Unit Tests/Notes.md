### 1. Start an app 
apps  are  a  good  way  to  keep  your code organised. Let’s start an app for our to-do lists:</br>
$ python manage.py startapp lists</br>

Files within the folder lists</br>

### 2. 
The basic distinction is that functional tests test the application from the outside, from the point of view of the user. Unit tests test the application from the inside, from the point of view of the programmer.</br>
The functional tests are driving what development we do from a high level, while the unit tests drive what we do at a low level.</br>
功能测试站在高层驱动开发，而单元测试则从低层驱动我们做些什么。</br>
Functional tests should help you build an application with the right functionality, and guarantee you never accidentally break it. Unit tests should help you to write code that’s clean and bug free．</br>
